# My-projects-in-C
Here, I have done my first project in C programming. That is a multiplication of two numbers and one or more of them contains gap. I have solved this problem in 2 ways. One is that I used for loop. and another one is that I used one by one multiplication and added the carries into previous digit and again multiplied.

And another project is making age calculator without using array, function. I used only if-else condition and for loop.
